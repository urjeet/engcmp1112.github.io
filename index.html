                            <p>As a Computer Science major getting ready to graduate, I look forward to applying to graduate school and advancing my education in the field of Computational Biology. An ideal audience to this rationale would be a future research supervisor or mentor. As many Ph.D. programs entail that students conduct independent research in a lab, I need to sell myself as someone who is diligent, perseverant, inventive, and proactive. Here is an ideal candidate profile that would fit the description.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Carter Washington is a Professor at the University of Toronto who specializes in Systems Biology and conducts research at the intersection of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics. His research has been acclaimed worldwide for creating modern solutions to fundamental biological problems. His research also lessens disparities and enables equity to take charge in the everchanging healthcare field that is driven by technology. He is looking for mentees to help further his research and in turn be developed into capable leaders of the field. As the field of Biology is raw with computational skills, he is looking for a computationally apt student who is interested in how computer science can be applied to real world issues. Apart from his work, he is a nature-loving family man. He loves spending time hiking in the Canadian ranges and has travelled to many countries from diving near the Coral Reefs to skiing in the Alps.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Social Media Conversation</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>

                            <p>From the previous blog, it is known that Cristiano Ronaldo uses Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to its fullest potential. His activity on these social medias can simply be described as “goal-oriented.” He is clearly on the pursuit of building up his fanbase and this has resulted in his profile being the most followed account on Instagram. He is also “goal-oriented” in that he delivers posts on these sites for the sole benefit of advertising other brands as well as his own “CR7” brand.</p>
                            <p>By filling out the Conversation Checklist, I was able to understand the motives behind each social media that Cristiano Ronaldo uses. Conversation topics for these sites include, “How do each of the social medias contribute to the goal?”, “What other keywords match with his persona and brand?”, and “What tone does he set?”</p>
                            <p>To begin analyzing these conversation topics, it is important to know why he uses these social medias specifically. Facebook is one of the earliest social media platforms and so appealing to an audience early on was very important as he truly rose to fame around 2009. Twitter is used for engaging with an audience through shorter posts that present personal thoughts over the posts of his social media team. Although, Cristiano Ronaldo does not tweet as often, he does use it as a secondary platform next to Instagram. Instagram is his premier social media which he also uses to sell consumer items through the integrated Marketplace.</p>
                            <p>Knowing his logical reasoning for using the said social medias, some more keywords come to light. Words such as “team player”, “phenomenon”, “unique”, and “world-class” all describe the brand and persona that Cristiano Ronaldo is. These words reflect in his social media as his posts follow a theme of community and building a network of fans that adore him. He highlights his remarkable plays on the field in his social media and follows through with the same charisma. This goes on to say that the tone he sets is optimistic and confident. Through team losses, he works to present himself as someone who will lead them to a triumphant win.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Social Media Audit</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
                            <div></div>
                            <p>468 Words</p>                
                            <p>Completing the social media audit worksheet made me notice aspects of my chosen “brand” that I had not previously considered. I chose the soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo, as my brand. His level and charisma off the field is just as remarkable as it is on the field. His personal brand “CR7” named after his initials and field number is acclaimed worldwide and, in a sense, competes with top athleisure clothing companies. </p>
                            <p>He is clearly augmented by a social media team who works to offer the best experience to his followers. Through analyzing his pages on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, I noticed that his Instagram has been the most active, making the most successful platform for his brand. By exploring Instagram, I found that it offers vast features that ultimately puts it above the other two platforms. Features such as images, the shop, reels, and IGTV all blend to add to the simplicity of Instagram making “following” your favorite celebrity truly a closer experience. Cristiano Ronaldo posts actively on Instagram just as he does on Facebook and Twitter. The difference is that Facebook and Twitter posts are mirror posts of those on Instagram, making Instagram the premium platform to access his life at the exact time it is made public. An interesting fact to note is that Cristiano Ronaldo is the most followed person ever on Instagram. That’s right, EVER. </p>
                            <p>Although the success on Instagram is impressive, a drawback to his follower count is that many of those accounts are inactive. The engagement on his posts are simply not up to par. At the time of this blog, Cristiano has 343 million followers, however, he only amounts 8 million likes and 90 thousand on average on his posts. If I was his social media manager, I would personally come up with more inventive posts that are goal-oriented in increasing engagement, such as giveaways and posts targeted toward his active demographics. </p>
                            <p>His brand persona is very consistent across the platforms with some minor differences. His only valid bio on a platform is Facebook, which is “Welcome to the OFFICIAL Facebook page of Cristiano Ronaldo.” His other two major accounts should follow the same format, however, they are missing a bio. One smart move his team makes is to link his Twitter and Instagram accounts in his Facebook bio, essentially driving the audience to different platforms. His Instagram, the most popular account, includes a link to his website where he also sells “CR7” brand. Apart from this his persona across the platforms is consistent with username, verification, and even posts and activity. </p>
                            <p>The theme with Cristiano Ronaldo is inevitably going to revolve around the game of soccer and his team. This is something I can follow for the future simply by highlighting my interests and acknowledging the people that elevate me.</p>

                            <p>With this virtual experience, I solved hypothetical scenarios. I first learned how to set up my system by downloading necessary repositories and dependencies through Git commands. Next, I fixed a client datafeed script through Python to interface stock price data feed. Then, I used JPMorgan Chase frameworks to deal with typescript files in the repository that were displaying the web application output incorrectly. Finally, I displayed the data visually to traders using JPMorgan Chase's Perspective. Currently, I am working on contributing to the open source project of Perspective.</p>
